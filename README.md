# HP2C-DT

Spain has set very ambitious energetic goals to achieve a fully sustainable, decarbonized and resilient energy system, as detailed in the [Plan Nacional Integrado de Energía y Clima (PNIEC) 2021-2030](https://www.miteco.gob.es/images/es/pnieccompleto_tcm30-508410.pdf). By 2030, 74% of power generation should come from renewable energy sources and the country must achieve emission neutrality by 2050, moving towards a 100% renewable energy electricity system. 

To achieve such ambitious renewable generation objectives, the [Plan España Digital (PED) 2025](https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/presidente/actividades/Documents/2020/230720-Espa%C3%B1aDigital_2025.pdf) discusses a key fact, which is the blended evolution of both the energy and digital transition. PED-2025 discusses how digitalization can contribute to achieve a more resilient and clean economy, as a key step to secure the PNIEC defined objectives on reducing greenhouse gases effect by increasing renewable energy generation and energy efficiency increase.

This project embraces the digital and ecological transition to develop a High-Precision High-Performance Computer-enabled Digital Twin (HP2C-DT) for modern power system applications. The HP2C-DT project aims to develop an innovative network Digital Twin (DT) concept, able to represent with a high degree of fidelity modern power systems in a wide variety of applications, such as transmission, distribution, generation, railway and industrial networks. The main project goal is to maximize their resilience and real-time performance during the high-demanding and challenging energy transition, achieving 100% renewable power networks.
